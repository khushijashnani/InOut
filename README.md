# InOut
A mobile app that aims at detecting and localizing the new covid norms such as (wearing masks and maintaining social distance) that are broken by people. It has been designed in a way for people to be more aware about their surroundings and help others. This project was developed as submission to the InOut 7.0 Hackathon.
